# ICanHasVideo
This is a video downloader for youtube and a bunch of other sources including all the german tv stuff aka ARTE-, ARD-, ZDF-, 3sat-Mediathek. Actually it's just a basic *youtube-dl* frontend for Mac OS X.
It's not yet done but working fine. Just paste or drag'n'drop the URL to the video and push the download button. The video will be saved to your desktop in the highest quality available.

**Known Issues**
- no icon yet
- no notification when the download is done
- no preferences at all

You don't need to compile and install *youtube-dl* as it's integrated in the bundle.
