# ICanHasVideo
This is a video downloader for youtube and most other sources. Actually it's just a basic *youtube-dl* frontend for Mac OS X.
It's not yet done but working fine. 

**Known Issues**
- no icon yet
- no notification when the download is done
- the video is always stored on the Desktop
- no preferences at all

You don't need to compile and install *youtube-dl* as it's integrated in the bundle.
